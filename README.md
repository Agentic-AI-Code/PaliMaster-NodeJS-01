# PaliQuest Backend

This is the backend service for PaliQuest, a gamified application designed to help users learn the Pali language. This service will handle user data, lesson content, game mechanics, and other server-side logic.

## Setup and Running

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <path-to-backend-directory>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    Based on `.env.example` (if provided), create a `.env` file and populate it with necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection strings, API keys).
4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the server using `nodemon`, which will automatically restart the server on file changes.
5.  **Run the production server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
